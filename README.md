In this project, a meta-model leveraging both feature fusion and decision fusion techniques has been developed. This model integrates the predictions of eight machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boost. Additionally, a neural network has been implemented to dynamically select the best model for making predictions based on the input data characteristics.
